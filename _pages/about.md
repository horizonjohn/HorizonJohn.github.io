- <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">I have a strong `interdisciplinary` background, spanning Engineering, Science, and Design. I truly enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields, and my vision is to integrate various technologies into our daily lives to improve efficiency and quality.</p>

- <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><b>Master</b>: My focus primarily revolved around leveraging Generative AI to assist designers in enhancing their design processes. This included tasks such as image generation, image translation, style transfer, and image retrieval, etc. I investigated methods like `Diffusion Models` (DM), `Generative Adversarial Networks` (GAN), `AutoEncoder` (AE), `Contrastive Learning`, `Vision Transformer` (ViT), `Graph Neural Network` (GNN), `CLIP`, `Transformer`, `LSTM`, etc.</p>

- <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><b>Undergraduate</b>: I gained extensive experience in various engineering projects, with a focus on `microcontroller development` (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi and Stm32, etc.), `PCB design` (Altium Designer), and `mechanical modeling analysis` (SolidWorks and Ansys, etc.). Additionally, I delved into `web design` (html/css), and engaged in `object detection` (YOLO and Faster-RCNN, etc.). In my freshman year, I joined the [Dean](https://iai.dhu.edu.cn/2021/0525/c20255a281050/page.htm)’s</a> research group, participating in three research projects. The final project, for which I was responsible, yielded significant results. It broke the limits of technology monopoly in the textile field and passed the national technical achievement appraisal, contributing to collaborative contracts with several industry-leading companies. Furthermore, I actively participated in various technological competitions and campus activities to enrich my academic experience and campus life as a whole.</p>

- 🔭 My research interests are Deep Learning and Its Applications, include `Deep Learning`, `Generative AI`, `Embedded System`, `Human-Computer Interaction`, etc.
