I have a strong `interdisciplinary` background, spanning Engineering, Science, and Design. I truly enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields, and my vision is to integrate various technologies into our daily lives to improve efficiency and quality.

`Master`: My focus primarily revolved around leveraging AI powers to assist designers in enhancing their design process. I investigated areas like:
- <b>Generative AI</b>: Diffusion Models, GANs, AutoEncoder.
- <b>Basic Structure</b>: Vision Transformers, CLIP, Transformer.
- <b>Efficient Learning</b>: Self-Supervised Learning, Few-shot Learning.

`Undergraduate`: I gained extensive experience in various engineering projects, focusing on the following interconnected aspects: <b>Microcontroller Development</b> (*Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi and Stm32, etc.*), <b>PCB Design</b> (*Altium Designer* ), and <b>Mechanical Modeling and Analysis</b> (*SolidWorks and Ansys, etc.*). Additionally, I delved into <b>Web Design</b> (*html/css* ) and <b>Object Detection</b> (*YOLO and Faster-RCNN, etc.*). In my freshman year, I joined the [<u>Dean</u>](https://iai.dhu.edu.cn/2021/0525/c20255a281050/page.htm)â€™s research group, participating in three research projects. The final project, for which I was responsible, yielded `significant` results. It broke the limits of technology monopoly in the textile field and passed the national technical achievement appraisal, contributing to collaborative contracts with several industry-leading companies. Furthermore, I actively participated in various technological competitions and campus activities to enrich my academic experience and campus life as a whole.

ðŸ”­ My research interests are Deep Learning and Its Applications, including `Generative AI`, `Embedded System`, `Human-Computer Interaction`, etc.
