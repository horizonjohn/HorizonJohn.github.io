- I have a strong `interdisciplinary` background, spanning Engineering, Science, and Design. I truly enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields, and my vision is to integrate various technologies into our daily lives to improve efficiency and quality.

- <b>Master</b>: My focus primarily revolved around leveraging AI powers to assist designers in enhancing their design processes, including:
  - <u>Generative AI</u>: Diffusion Models, GANs, AutoEncoder.
  - <u>Basic Structure</u>: ViTs, CLIP, Transformer.
  - <u>Efficient Learning</u>: Contrastive Learning, Few-shot Learning.

- <b>Undergraduate</b>: I gained extensive experience in various engineering projects, with a focus on <u>microcontroller development</u> (*Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi and Stm32, etc.*), <u>PCB design</u> (*Altium Designer* ), and <u>mechanical modeling analysis</u> (*SolidWorks and Ansys, etc.*). Additionally, I delved into <u>web design</u> (*html/css* ), and engaged in <u>object detection</u> (*YOLO and Faster-RCNN, etc.*). In my freshman year, I joined the [Dean](https://iai.dhu.edu.cn/2021/0525/c20255a281050/page.htm)â€™s research group, participating in three research projects. The final project, for which I was responsible, yielded `significant` results. It broke the limits of technology monopoly in the textile field and passed the national technical achievement appraisal, contributing to collaborative contracts with several industry-leading companies. Furthermore, I actively participated in various technological competitions and campus activities to enrich my academic experience and campus life as a whole.

- ðŸ”­ My research interests are Deep Learning and Its Applications, include `Deep Learning`, `Generative AI`, `Embedded System`, `Human-Computer Interaction`, etc.
