I have a strong `interdisciplinary` background. I truly enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields, and my vision is to integrate various technologies into human daily lives to improve our efficiency and quality.

üîç <b>Master</b>: My focus primarily revolved around leveraging AI powers to assist designers in enhancing their design process. I investigated areas:
- <b>Generative AI</b>: Diffusion Models, GANs, AutoEncoder.
- <b>Basic Structure</b>: Vision Transformers, CLIP, Transformer.
- <b>Efficient Learning</b>: Self-Supervised Learning, Few-shot Learning.

üîç <b>Undergraduate</b>: I gained extensive experience in various engineering projects, focusing on the following interconnected aspects: 
- <b>Microcontroller Development</b>: Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, Stm32, Arduino.
- <b>PCB Design</b>: Altium Designer.
- <b>Mechanical Modeling and Analysis</b>: SolidWorks, Ansys.
- <b>Deep Learning</b>: Image Classfication, Object Detection.

<u>In my freshman year</u>, I joined the [<u>Dean</u>](https://iai.dhu.edu.cn/2021/0525/c20255a281050/page.htm)‚Äôs research group, participating in three projects. The final project, for which I was responsible, yielded `significant` results. It broke the limits of technology monopoly in the textile field and passed the technical achievement appraisal, contributing to collaborative contracts with several industry-leading companies. <u>Furthermore</u>, I actively participated in various technological competitions and campus activities to enrich my academic experience and campus life as a whole.

üî≠ My research interests are <u>Deep Learning and Its Applications</u>, including `Generative AI`, `Embedded System`, `Human-Computer Interaction`, etc.
